{"/":{"title":"Brain Sap","content":"\n\u003e *Approaching an old wooden door, your ears catch the enigmatic whisper of a steady dribbling.*\n\nDon't worry about that sound. It's just thoughts trickling from my brain. Feel free to step in.\n\n\u003e _Stepping into the room, you find yourself engulfed in shadows. Yet, from an aged writing table in the corner, a solitary candle casts a feeble glow, its flickering dance barely piercing the gloom. In the opposing corner, a wooden shelf stands, upon which mysterious bottles beckon. Adjacent to it, grand wooden barrels rest, silent and imposing._\n\nApologies for the mess; I wasn't expecting visitors. Please feel free to look around. I'll be at the writing table if you need me.\n\n\u003e *As you take a step forward, poised to place your foot upon the cold stone floor, a voice interrupts. It is the same man.*\n\nAnd be mindful of those droplets on the floor if you'd like to keep your shoes clean. I haven't had the time to bottle them up yet.\n\n## What is this place?\n\nYou might assume this is just a blog, but it's actually my digital garden â€“ Roni's space. It serves as a public repository for my thoughts - a place where I think and link my thoughts together. I crafted this space primarily for **myself**. \n\nWhile you might discover useful insights here, I offer no guarantees. Some areas of the garden might be entwined and chaotic, and I embrace that.\n\n## How does this work?\n\nWhile the layout of this digital garden is intentionally messy, I've labeled notes with tags to better signify their current status.\n\n- [#sap](/tags/sap/) - raw thoughts extracted from my brain. Usually very undeveloped and short scribbles, densely linked to other notes\n- [#brewing](/tags/brewing) - thoughts and ideas that have gotten a little bit more love\n- [#bottled](/tags/bottled/) - well-developed thoughts, stored for later\n\n## Some places to get started\n\n\u003e *Casting your gaze about the room, several intriguing features beckon your curiosity. Perhaps it's time to delve deeper into one of these mysteries.*\n\n- [Droplets on the floor](/tags/sap/)\n- [Set of wooden barrels](/tags/brewing/)\n- [Wooden shelf](/tags/bottled/)\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-13T09:46:13.59834712Z","tags":[]},"/notes/Test-note":{"title":"Test note","content":"\nTest note","lastmodified":"2023-08-13T09:46:13.59834712Z","tags":["sap","brewing","bottled"]}}
