> _Approaching an old wooden door, your ears catch the enigmatic whisper of a steady dribbling.

Don't worry about that sound. It's just thoughts trickling from my brain. Feel free to step in.

> _Stepping into the room, you find yourself engulfed in shadows. Yet, from an aged writing table in the corner, a solitary candle casts a feeble glow, its flickering dance barely piercing the gloom. In the opposing corner, a wooden shelf stands, upon which mysterious bottles beckon. Adjacent to it, grand wooden barrels rest, silent and imposing._

Apologies for the mess; I wasn't expecting visitors. Please feel free to look around. I'll be at the writing table if you need me.

> *As you take a step forward, poised to place your foot upon the cold stone floor, a voice interrupts. It is the same man.*

And be mindful of those droplets on the floor if you'd like to keep your shoes clean. I haven't had the time to bottle them up yet.

## What is this place?

You might assume this is just a blog, but it's actually my digital garden â€“ Roni's space. It serves as a public repository for my thoughts - a place where I think and link my thoughts together. I crafted this space primarily for **myself**. 

While you might discover useful insights here, I offer no guarantees. Some areas of the garden might be entwined and chaotic, and I embrace that.

## How does this work?

While the layout of this digital garden is intentionally messy, I've labeled notes with tags to better signify their current status.

- #sap - raw thoughts extracted from my brain. Usually very undeveloped and short scribbles, densely linked to other notes
- #brewing - thoughts and ideas that have gotten a little bit more love
- #bottled - well-developed thoughts, stored for later
